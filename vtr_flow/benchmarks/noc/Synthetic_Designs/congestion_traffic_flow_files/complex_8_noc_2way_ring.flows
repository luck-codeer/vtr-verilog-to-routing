<traffic_flows>

    <!--
        In this benchmark, each NoC routers sends traffic flows to two
        NoC routers after itself. These two traffic flows cannot share the
        same NoC link without causing congestion. Therefore, they should be
        routed without using any shared links. This benchmark is a simple
        sanity check for congestion-aware NoC placement and traffic flow routing
        algorithms.
